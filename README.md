The linkurious.js toolkit is dual-licensed, **available under both commercial and open-source licenses**. The open-source license is the GNU General Public License v.3 ("GPL"). In addition to GPL, the Linkurious.js toolkit is available under commercial license terms from [Linkurious SAS](http://linkurio.us).

GPL has been chosen as the open-source license for linkurious.js, because it provides the following four degrees of freedom:

1. The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
2. The freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to specific needs.
3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
4. The freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

These four degrees of freedom are very important for the success of linkurious.js, and it is important that all users of linkurious.js under GPL adhere to these and fully meet all the requirements set by the GPL. It is recommended that a thorough legal analysis is conducted when choosing to use the GPL or other open-source licenses. **If your application restricts any of these freedoms, such as commercial or closed-source applications, then the GPL license is not suited and you must contact us to buy a commercial license at contact@linkurio.us.**
